\section{Naive/brute force Algorithms}
\label{sec:naive}
The algorithms presented in this section are the direct solutions to the problem characterized by \eqref{eq:symbolic-optimization-with-minflow2}. For both tree types introduced in section \ref{sec:tree-feas-sets} the optimization problem is formulated as the corresponding MILP/NLP. An attempt is made to solve these problems to full optimality.
