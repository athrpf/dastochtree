\section{Naive/brute force Algorithms}
\label{sec:naive}
The algorithms presented in this section are the direct applications of state-of-the-art MILP and NLP solvers to the problem characterized by \eqref{eq:symbolic-optimization-with-minflow2}. For both tree types introduced in section \ref{sec:scen-tree-generation} the optimization problem is formulated as the corresponding MILP/NLP. An attempt is made to solve these problems to full optimality.

This section is at the same time crucial and unimportant to the argument of this thesis.
It is crucial, because here, algorithms are presented that solve the tree generation problem to full optimality.
These optimal values are later used to assess the quality of the approximation algorithms presented in section \ref{sec:expect-max-algos}, which otherwise would be impossible.
Secondly, it is important, because it shows that the classic optimization algorithms fail for all except small toy problems.
This is exactly the reason why this section is unimportant: None of the algorithms presented here are of any practical use.
The hurried reader is therefore advised to skip to section \ref{sec:two-theorems}.
