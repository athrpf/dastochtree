\section{Conclusion}
In this work, a new algorithm to solve the optimal tree generation problem for multi-stage stochastic programming has been proposed.
The new algorithm is based on the K-Means algorithm and is shown to scale very well with the size of the data set, as well as reach near-optimal solutions.

Building on the success of this algorithm, the application of probabilistic generative models to scenario tree generation is discussed.
A generic algorithmic framework is presented for generating scenario trees based on these models.
It is shown how such a model can be used to estimate the accuracy of the approximation.
