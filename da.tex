\section{Stochastic Programming Theory}
Consider the following real world problem:

An operator in charge of a pumped hydro plant at any given time wants to make the optimal decision whether to pump water up into his reservoir with electrical power purchased at current spot market prices, do nothing, or release water from the reservoir and sell it at the spot market. 

For an introduction into the general theory see \cite{Birge1997}. For a more recent overview on optimization under uncertainty, see \cite{Sahinidis2004} and the references therein.
% here, explain the following terms:
% - value of the stochastic solution
% - perfect foresight
% - here and now / wait and see

% \section{Scenario tree generation}
The generation of the scenario tree is a key step in the solution of stochastic programming problems.

In this paper we will present several ways to generate said scenario trees. The section is organized as follows. First, a short introduction to the basic mathematical theory will be given that is necessary to follow the derivations of the algorithms. Then, the state of the art in solving this problem is summarized. Finally, several new algorithms are derived. These new algorithms will differ from the ones proposed in the literature in that they attempt to solve the original problem to full optimality. The section will close with a discussion and comparison of the results of the presented algorithms.
